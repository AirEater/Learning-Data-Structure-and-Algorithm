Data type that stores datas:
i) Primitive Data type                \\ eg. int a; float b; char c; double d;
ii) User-defined type or structured   \\ eg. struct a{\*...*\}; class, which is defined by user and stores vary of datas

Data type that stores data:
Pointer - a pointer is a variable that stores address

We define pointer by doing:
\\...(skiped header ,namespace, int main())
int number = 10;
int* ptr;       \\ this means we created an pointer names "ptr" that can only stores integer data type address
ptr = &number;  \\ we assign the address of "number" to pointer "ptr"

\\the below code is same as line 11 to 12, use one line instead of 2 line
\*
int* ptr = &number;
*\

pointer "ptr" now holds the address of "number"
as we want to see what's inside the pointer that we are pointing to
we can use '*' operator to dereference "ptr" as example below:

cout << *ptr; \\ this will display the value that stored in "number"

what if we have struct Person{\*...*\}; and we want to declare a pointer to a struct.
ans:
Person* ptr; \\ we declare a pointer that can only stores "Person" user-defined data type address

========================================================================================================================
example:

struct Person{
  char name[20],
  float money;
};
int main(){
  Person Alex; \\ to access member of structure we can use '.': Alex.money = 5.5;
